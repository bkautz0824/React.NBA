This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Run the following commands:
    
    npm install
    OR
    yarn
    
## There's an easter egg in this one! If you want to check out the login component run the following:

    nmp install json-server
    npx json-server --watch src/userInfo/users.json
    npm install axios

# The login process is NOT secure at all but stands up a functional API for testing purposed which is pretty cool
# Would really appreciate some feedback on this one :)
